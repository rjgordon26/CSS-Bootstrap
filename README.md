# CSS Bootstrap Portfolio

In this task I was to create a portfolio for myself. I used Bootstrap and CSS to build my webpage. This task was the toughest yet, but I still enjoyed the challenge. I feel I could've done better on the responsiveness of the web pages but I couldn't get them to work how I wanted.

Next time I plan on asking more questions after class, and taking up until the last minute to finish. Overall though I liked being able to be creative with a webpage and see it actually work. This excites me for future projects.
